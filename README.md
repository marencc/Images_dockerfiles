# Images_dockerfiles
Create necessary images
In order to use the INSPIIRED suite. I had to create the corresponding docker file. 
It can be deployed in any system that has docker and meets the computing requirements.
Our lab's own integration site fastq had 15 mill reads. We had to scalate those requirements. 

In added files I've attached the history from the VBox as well as the recommended libraries to 
be installed with conda. 

The final (and currently working) dockerfile is: Final_dockerfile.txt
